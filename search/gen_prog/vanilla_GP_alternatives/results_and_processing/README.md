# Results and Processing

The results from the research are shown as plots in the plots directory at this level. The actual result files are not 
included because of their filesize.

To run the processing files move them to the same level as main.py, or change the filepaths. Also change the actual 
filenames in the processing files. The resulting plots of the processing files will be put in the plots directory at the level of main.py, if the files are also moved there.

countFileStats.py creates some stats about the input file. To run it on a file move it to the same level as main.py or change its path. Also change the actual filename to the file that you want to evaluate.
